# Title : stock_markets

# Description : 

A Python TKinter project that parses data off the Google Finance Website for a list of Companies on the main GUI menu. Data displayed includes stock data for the day, as well as a constructed graph for the stock's opening and closing values over the last year.

# Installation : 

Ensure that Python is installed on the machine this script is running on. Download and extract all files of this project to a workplace. For the programme to work, ensure to pip install matplotlib, which is the library used for plotting the graphs.

# Running The Programme:

Not mandatory, but beneficial to run with an IDE. Run the main.py file. This will bring up the main GUI, from where you can select the desired company to view the stock data and graphs for. The data will be shown for the most recent day, whereas the graphs plotted will be of the opening and closing values of the stock over the last year.
